Open source BACnet mstp controller hardware, software with cloud

This project an attempt to give back to arduino community and makers who wish to make full working BACnet mstp controller with IoT. My aim to make this hardware design available to everyone and provide basic full working functionality of the BACnet mstp capability. The BACnet library will be collection of inspiration from open source BACnet project with detailed help from myself and other enthusiasits. So it will be written in such a way where the open source community may love to use. 

Anyone welcome to contribute,donate or support.

Any organization want to use this project,You are free to use and donate(anything above 1$ is fine!!)if you wish. 

The hardware compatiability, functionality and performance is important so i will make some full working hardware and a sample cloud interface. The goal is make this code which shall work after the compilation on the fly.
